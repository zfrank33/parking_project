parking garage and timer class
i worked on the timer
created a timer that counts down to 0that to let customer know whow time they had left before being charged an extra $5 in tem min intervals
the timercan is called w submit() and once time runs out it informs the customer they have been charged an extra $5
i originaly wanted to import the function and then call the function using an if loop. At first I could not get the import right but when i finally did it would cut the parking garage function off and not let it run full cycle so for now it has to be called manually.
